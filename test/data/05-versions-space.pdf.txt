Employees are classified as full-time, part-time, temporary, or contract. Exempt and non-exempt status
is determined according to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).

Employees must maintain professionalism and ethical behavior at all times. Harassment,
discrimination, violence, or retaliation will not be tolerated. Employees are expected to use good
judgment and act in the best interests of the company.
Attendance and Punctuality
Regular attendance is essential for company operations. Employees should report absences or
tardiness to their supervisor as soon as possible. Excessive absenteeism may lead to disciplinary
action.

Employees are expected to dress appropriately for their position and work environment. Business
casual is the general standard, though some departments may require formal attire or safety gear.
